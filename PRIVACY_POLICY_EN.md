Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 30 Nov 2025

Overview
Your privacy is our priority.
We built Shubh Aarambh so that we never need to know who you are.
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information — not even anonymous analytics.
Because we don’t collect data:
    • We never identify, track, or profile you
    • We never sell or share information with third parties
    • We avoid handling sensitive data entirely
    • All processing happens locally on your device
    • Nothing is uploaded to external servers (we don’t have servers)
Our goal is simple:
Shubh Aarambh should work beautifully without knowing anything about you.

Our Privacy Commitment
We collect ZERO data.
No personal information.
No location history.
No analytics.
No tracking.
No crash reports.
No ads.
Everything remains on your device.

What We Collect
Nothing.
We do not collect, store, transmit, or access:
    • Personal details
    • Location data
    • Device identifiers
    • Usage analytics
    • Contacts, messages, photos
    • Sensitive information of any kind
Your data stays entirely with you.

Location Access
If you grant location permission, it is used only on your device to calculate:
    • Sunrise & sunset
    • Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, Karana
    • Muhurta & Panchang timings
    • Other astronomy-based events
We do not:
    • Store your location
    • Upload location data
    • Track movement
    • Log your coordinates
You can also deny permission and choose your city manually — the app works either way.

Data Storage
All app data stays locally on your device.
Uninstalling the app removes everything.
We do not use cloud services, external servers, or databases.

Children’s Privacy
Since no data is collected from any user, the app is compliant with children’s privacy laws by default.

Your Control
You control all permissions.
You can:
    • Allow or deny location access
    • Change permissions anytime
    • Use the app without sharing any information
No login, signup, or identity is ever required.

Security
Because all processing happens on your device:
    • No data leaves your device
    • No server breaches are possible
    • No third-party access exists
    • No centralized data exists to be hacked
Your device’s built-in protections keep your information safe.

Changes to Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy occasionally.
Changes will be communicated through:
    • App updates with release notes
    • Updated “Last Updated” date at the top of this document
    • Notification inside the app (for major changes)
Continued use of Shubh Aarambh after any changes means you accept the updated policy.
