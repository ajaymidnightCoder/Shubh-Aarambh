# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** 02 Dec 2025

## Overview
Your privacy is our priority.  
We built Shubh Aarambh so that we never need to know who you are.  
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information — not even anonymous analytics.

Because we don’t collect data:
- We never identify, track, or profile you  
- We never sell or share information with third parties  
- We avoid handling sensitive data entirely  
- All processing happens locally on your device  
- Nothing is uploaded to external servers

Our goal is simple:  
**Shubh Aarambh should work beautifully without knowing anything about you.**

## Our Privacy Commitment
We collect **ZERO data**.  
No personal information.  
No location history.  
No analytics.  
No tracking.  
No crash reports.  
No ads.  

Everything remains on your device.

## What We Collect
**Nothing.**

We do not collect, store, transmit, or access:
- Personal details  
- Location data  
- Device identifiers  
- Usage analytics  
- Contacts, messages, photos  
- Sensitive information of any kind  

Your data stays entirely with you.

---

## Location Access
If you grant location permission, it is used **only on your device** to calculate:
- Sunrise & sunset  
- Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, Karana  
- Muhurta & Panchang timings  
- Other astronomy-based events  

We do **not**:
- Store your location  
- Upload location data  
- Track movement  
- Log your coordinates  

You may deny permission and choose your city manually — the app works either way.

---

## Data Storage
All app data stays **locally on your device**.  
Uninstalling the app removes everything.

We do not use cloud services, external servers, or databases.

---

## Children’s Privacy
Since no data is collected from any user, the app complies with children's privacy laws by default.

---

## Your Control
You control all permissions.  
You can:
- Allow or deny location access  
- Change permissions anytime  
- Use the app without sharing any information  

No login, signup, or identity is ever required.

---

## Security
Because all processing happens on your device:
- No data leaves your device  
- No server breaches are possible  
- No third-party access exists  
- No centralized data exists to be hacked  

Your device’s built-in protections keep your information safe.

---

## Changes to Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy occasionally.  
Changes will be communicated through:
- App updates with release notes  
- Updated “Last Updated” date  
- Notifications inside the app (for major changes)

Continued use of **Shubh Aarambh** after any changes means you accept the updated policy.
